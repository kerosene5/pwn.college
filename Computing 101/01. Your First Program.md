# Module 1: Your First Program
This module is an intro to computer architecture. We will be looking into __x86__ architecture into particular. __x86__ was created by Intel in the dawn of the PC age, and has continued to evolve over the years.
Together, __x86__ and __ARM__ (a different, less cool architecture) make up the majority of PC CPUs out there.
# Challenges
## Your First Register
In this challenge, you will write your first assembly. 
You must move the value `60` into `rax`. Write your program in a file with a `.s` extension, such as `rax-challenge.s`.
```
hacker@your-first-program~your-first-register:~$ touch rax.s
hacker@your-first-program~your-first-register:~$ echo "mov rax,60" > rax.s
hacker@your-first-program~your-first-register:~$ /challenge/check rax.s

Checking the assembly code...
... YES! Great job!


Congratulations, you have written your first program!
Now let's see what happens when you run it:

hacker@your-first-program~your-first-register:~$ /tmp/your-program
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
hacker@your-first-program~your-first-register:~$ 

... uh oh. The program crashed! We'll go into more details about
what a Segmentation Fault is later, but in this case, the program
crashed because, after the CPU moved the value 60 into rax, it was
never instructed to stop execution. With no further instructions
to execute, and no directive to stop, it crashed.

In the next level, we'll learn about how to stop program execution.
For now, here is your flag for your first (crashing) program!


Here is your flag!

```
## Your First Syscall
In this challenge, we'll learn our first syscall: `exit`. 
The `exit` syscall causes a program to exit. By explicitly exiting, we can avoid the crash we ran into with our previous program.
```
mov rax, 60
syscall
```

Now, the syscall number of `exit` is `60`. Go and write your first program: it should move `60` into `rax`, then invoke `syscall` to cleanly exit.
```
hacker@your-first-program~your-first-syscall:~$ vim rax.s
hacker@your-first-program~your-first-syscall:~$ /challenge/check rax.s

Checking the assembly code...
... YES! Great job!

Okay, now you have written your first COMPLETE program!
All it'll do is exit, but it'll do so cleanly, and we can
build from there!

Let's see what happens when you run it:

hacker@your-first-program~your-first-syscall:~$ /tmp/your-program
hacker@your-first-program~your-first-syscall:~$ 

Neat! Your program exited cleanly! Let's push on to make things
more interesting! Take this with you:


Here is your flag!
