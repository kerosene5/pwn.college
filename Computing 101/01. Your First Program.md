# Module 1: Your First Program
This module is an intro to computer architecture. We will be looking into __x86__ architecture into particular. __x86__ was created by Intel in the dawn of the PC age, and has continued to evolve over the years.
Together, __x86__ and __ARM__ (a different, less cool architecture) make up the majority of PC CPUs out there.
# Challenges
## Your First Register
In this challenge, you will write your first assembly. 
You must move the value `60` into `rax`. Write your program in a file with a `.s` extension, such as `rax-challenge.s`.
```
hacker@your-first-program~your-first-register:~$ touch rax.s
hacker@your-first-program~your-first-register:~$ echo "mov rax,60" > rax.s
hacker@your-first-program~your-first-register:~$ /challenge/check rax.s

Checking the assembly code...
... YES! Great job!


Congratulations, you have written your first program!
Now let's see what happens when you run it:

hacker@your-first-program~your-first-register:~$ /tmp/your-program
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
hacker@your-first-program~your-first-register:~$ 

... uh oh. The program crashed! We'll go into more details about
what a Segmentation Fault is later, but in this case, the program
crashed because, after the CPU moved the value 60 into rax, it was
never instructed to stop execution. With no further instructions
to execute, and no directive to stop, it crashed.

In the next level, we'll learn about how to stop program execution.
For now, here is your flag for your first (crashing) program!


Here is your flag!
pwn.college{wMMVk1gNhM3gr9FTfk_oA5jLJvE.dNDN4UDL0QjN5YzW}
```
## Your First Syscall
In this challenge, we'll learn our first syscall: `exit`. 
The `exit` syscall causes a program to exit. By explicitly exiting, we can avoid the crash we ran into with our previous program.
```
mov rax, 60
syscall
```

Now, the syscall number of `exit` is `60`. Go and write your first program: it should move `60` into `rax`, then invoke `syscall` to cleanly exit.
```
hacker@your-first-program~your-first-syscall:~$ vim rax.s
hacker@your-first-program~your-first-syscall:~$ /challenge/check rax.s

Checking the assembly code...
... YES! Great job!

Okay, now you have written your first COMPLETE program!
All it'll do is exit, but it'll do so cleanly, and we can
build from there!

Let's see what happens when you run it:

hacker@your-first-program~your-first-syscall:~$ /tmp/your-program
hacker@your-first-program~your-first-syscall:~$ 

Neat! Your program exited cleanly! Let's push on to make things
more interesting! Take this with you:


Here is your flag!

```
## Exit Codes
As you might know, every program exits with an exit code as it terminates. This is done by passing a parameter to the exit system call.

Similarly to how a system call number (e.g., `60` for `exit`) is specified in the `rax` variable, parameters are also passed to the syscall through registers. System calls can take multiple parameters, though `exit` takes only one: the exit code. The first parameter to a system call is passed via another register: `rdi`. `rdi` is what we will focus on in this challenge.

In this challenge, you must make your program exit with the `exit` code of `42`. Thus, your program will need three instructions:

    1.Set your program's exit code (move it into rdi).
    2.Set the system call number of the exit syscall (mov rax, 60).
    3.syscall!

Now, go and do it!
```
hacker@your-first-program~exit-codes:~$ vim rax.s
hacker@your-first-program~exit-codes:~$ /challenge/check rax.s

Checking the assembly code...
... YES! Great job!

Let's check what your exit code is! It should be 42 to succeed!

Go go go!

hacker@your-first-program~exit-codes:~$ /tmp/your-program
hacker@your-first-program~exit-codes:~$ echo $?
42
hacker@your-first-program~exit-codes:~$ 

Neat! Your program exited with the correct error code! But in this level,
we built the executable for you. Next, you'll learn how to build the executable
yourself, and then you'll be ready to walk the path of Assembly!

For now, take this with you:

## Building Executables
To build an executable binary, you need to:

    1.Write your assembly in a file (often with a .S or .s syntax. We'll use asm.s in this example).
    2.Assemble your binary into an executable object file (using the as command).
    3.Link one or more executable object files into a final executable binary (using the ld command).
Assembling Code:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ cat asm.s
.intel_syntax noprefix
mov rdi, 42
mov rax, 60
syscall
hacker@dojo:~$
```
Assembling Object Files:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
asm.s
hacker@dojo:~$ cat asm.s
.intel_syntax noprefix
mov rdi, 42
mov rax, 60
syscall
hacker@dojo:~$ as -o asm.o asm.s
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
asm.o   asm.s
hacker@dojo:~$
```
Linking Executables:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
asm.o   asm.s
hacker@dojo:~$ ld -o exe asm.o
ld: warning: cannot find entry symbol _start; defaulting to 0000000000401000
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
asm.o   asm.s   exe
hacker@dojo:~$
```

Neat! Now you can build programs. In this challenge, go ahead and run through these steps yourself. Build your executable, and pass it to `/challenge/check` for the flag!
```
hacker@your-first-program~building-executables:~$ vim asm.s
hacker@your-first-program~building-executables:~$ vim asm.s
hacker@your-first-program~building-executables:~$ as -o asm.o asm.s
hacker@your-first-program~building-executables:~$ ld -o exe asm.o
/nix/store/q3sm4x963a996qc3d6baw54609ryifak-binutils-2.41/bin/ld: warning: cannot find entry symbol _start; defaulting to 0000000000401000
hacker@your-first-program~building-executables:~$ /challenge/check exe

Checking the assembly code...
... YES! Great job!

Let's check what your exit code is! It should be 42 to succeed!

Go go go!

hacker@your-first-program~building-executables:~$ /tmp/your-program
hacker@your-first-program~building-executables:~$ echo $?
42
hacker@your-first-program~building-executables:~$ 

Neat! Your program exited with the correct error code! But what
if it hadn't? Next, we'll learn about some simple debugging.
For now, take this with you:

Here is your flag!
pwn.college{gC_qp6f1PrY0HopphDFA8xAKqro.QXwcjMwEDL0QjN5YzW}
```
## Tracing Syscalls
In this challenge, you must `strace` the `/challenge/trace-me program` to figure out what value it passes as a parameter to the `alarm` system call, then call `/challenge/submit-number` with the number you've retrieved as the argument. Good luck!
```
hacker@your-first-program~tracing-syscalls:~$ strace /challenge/trace-me
execve("/challenge/trace-me", ["/challenge/trace-me"], 0x7ffec96b83a0 /* 29 vars */) = 0
alarm(20752)                            = 0
exit(0)                                 = ?
+++ exited with 0 +++
hacker@your-first-program~tracing-syscalls:~$ /challenge/submit-number 20752
CORRECT! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4EOt334dg6WYungUDEKbneRjXpl.dFzN4UDL0QjN5YzW}
```
## Moving Between Registers
In this challenge, we will store a secret value in the `rsi` register, and your program must `exit` with that value as the return code. Since `exit` uses the value stored in `rdi` as the return code, you'll need to move the secret value in `rsi` into `rdi`. 
```
hacker@your-first-program~moving-between-registers:~$ vim asm.s
hacker@your-first-program~moving-between-registers:~$ /challenge/check asm.s

Checking the assembly code...
... YES! Great job!

Let's check what your exit code is! It should be our secret
value stored in register rsi (value 124) to succeed!

hacker@your-first-program~moving-between-registers:~$ /tmp/your-program
hacker@your-first-program~moving-between-registers:~$ echo $?
124
hacker@your-first-program~moving-between-registers:~$ 

Neat! Your program passed the tests! Great job!

Here is your flag!
pwn.college{ALrKkF9B3qUGrENtZnrNX1Frz7Q.dlDN1YDL0QjN5YzW}
