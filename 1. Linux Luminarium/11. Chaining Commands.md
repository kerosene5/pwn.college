# Module 11: Chaining Commands
# Challenges
## Chaining with Semicolons
This challenge introduces the concept of chaining commands using `;`. As you can see below, we chained two commands, `/challenge/pwn` and `/challenge/college` using `;` in order to get the flag.
```
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn ; /challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{I7twOY2S7gTJgMf7uXbTb05TZQE.dVTN4QDL0QjN5YzW}
```
## Your First Shell Script
I created a `x.sh` shell script and added `/challenge/pwn ; /challenge/college` commands inside it using the nano text editor. After saving the script, i ran it with `bash x.sh` in order to obtain the flag.
```
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ touch x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ nano x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ 
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ bash x.sh
Great job, you've written your first shell script! Here is the flag:
pwn.college{IV9yINHFWIMdTIDQ7ARhv4ld9pl.dFzN4QDL0QjN5YzW}
```
## Redirecting Script Output
Here, I used the `Vim` text editor to create the `x.sh` shell script with the required commands in it. After that, piping `x.sh` into `/challenge/solve` was done in order to get the flag.
```
hacker@chaining~redirecting-script-output:~$ vim x.sh
hacker@chaining~redirecting-script-output:~$ bash x.sh
It looks like you are not piping this script out to /challenge/solve! Remember 
to pipe the output of your script into /challenge/solve using '|'.
hacker@chaining~redirecting-script-output:~$ bash x.sh | /challenge/solve
Correct! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{EnprUAAJhyMMX0olpFc68NmP3WR.dhTM5QDL0QjN5YzW}
```
## Executable Shell Scripts
In this challenge, I again used `Vim` to create a script and write the command `/challenge/solve` into it. After saving with `:wq`, I used `chmod+x` to make the script executable and then ran it in the terminal to get the flag.
```
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ vim x.sh
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ chmod +x x.sh
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ x.sh
bash: x.sh: command not found
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ ./x.sh
Congratulations on your shell script execution! Your flag:
pwn.college{EOg50mqpTu_L2hcWdkPCXhBlBmK.dRzNyUDL0QjN5YzW}
```
