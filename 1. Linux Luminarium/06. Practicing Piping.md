# Module 6: Practicing Piping
Piping is accomplished using the pipe symbol `|`. This symbol allows the output of one command to be used as the input for another command, facilitating a sequence of operations without the need for intermediate files.

The module teaches us about the three main channels in linux: `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`.
# Challenges
## Redirecting output
We can redirect the standard output using `>` character like so: `echo hi > another`

This will redirect the output of echo hi (which will be hi) to the file another. You can then use a program
such as `cat` to output this file. We can also append the output of multiple files to a single file using `>>`.

For this challenge we need to redirect the string `PWN` into a file named `COLLEGE` using the `>` command. We do this by simply typing `echo PWN > COLLEGE` in the terminal.
```
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your 
flag:
pwn.college{QntA477tQkX5rLYoj0F5kfg8bBV.dRjN1QDLxITN0czW}
```
## Redirecting more output
Here, we redirect the output of `/challenge/run` which is the flag, to the file `myflag`.
```
hacker@piping~redirecting-more-output:~$ /challenge/run > myflag
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge will check that output is redirected to a specific file path : myflag
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /flag

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the /flag file.

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to a file called myflag. Checking...

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stdout looks okay!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
hacker@piping~redirecting-more-output:~$ cat myflag

[FLAG] Here is your flag:
[FLAG] pwn.college{kM_zSDh5djsL5m2D0x532it_wA0.dVjN1QDL3IDO0czW}
```
## Appending output
Here, `/challenge/run` writes the first half of the flag directly to the file when using `>`. For the second half, we need to use `>>` to append the second half into the same file.
```
hacker@piping~appending-output:~$ /challenge/run >> /home/hacker/the-flag
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge will check that output is redirected to a specific file path : /home/hacker/the-flag

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] Good luck!

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to a file called /home/hacker/the-flag. Checking...

[HINT] File descriptors are inherited from the parent, unless the FD_CLOEXEC is set by the parent on the file descriptor.
[HINT] For security reasons, some programs, such as python, do this by default in certain cases. Be careful if you are
[HINT] creating and trying to pass in FDs in python.

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stdout looks okay!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
I will write the flag in two parts to the file /home/hacker/the-flag! I'll do
the first write directly to the file, and the second write, I'll do to stdout
(if it's pointing at the file). If you redirect the output in append mode, the
second write will append to (rather than overwrite) the first write, and you'll
get the whole flag!
hacker@piping~appending-output:~$ cat /home/hacker/the-flag
 |
\|/ This is the first half:
 v
pwn.college{kM_zSDh5djsL5m2D0x532it_wA0.dVjN1QDL3IDO0czW}
                              ^
     that is the second half /|\
                              |

If you only see the second half above, you redirected in *truncate* mode (>)
rather than *append* mode (>>), and so the write of the second half to stdout
overwrote the initial write of the first half directly to the file. Try append
mode!
```
## Redirecting errors
Just like standard output, we can also redirect the error channel of commands. This can be done using the `2>` character. The 2 is because of the File Descriptor Number. Below is the list of FD Numbers:
* FD 0: Standard Input
* FD 1: Standard Output
* FD 2: Standard Error

When we redirect process communication, we do it by FD number, though some FD numbers are implicit. For example, a `>` without a number implies `1>`, which redirects FD 1 (Standard Output).

We can also redirect input using `<`.

For this challenge, we redirected the instructions of the `/challenge/run` command to the `instructions` file and the output to the `myflag` file, giving us the flag.

```
hacker@piping~redirecting-errors:~$ /challenge/run > myflag 2> instructions
hacker@piping~redirecting-errors:~$ cat myflag

[FLAG] Here is your flag:
[FLAG] pwn.college{ERLgNN8m3kCliND7kfqHmTqkTpb.ddDM5QDL3IDO0czW}

hacker@piping~redirecting-errors:~$ cat instructions
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge will check that output is redirected to a specific file path : myflag
[INFO] - the challenge will check that error output is redirected to a specific file path : instructions
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /flag

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the /flag file.

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to a file called myflag. Checking...

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stdout looks okay!

[TEST] You should have redirected my stderr to instructions. Checking...

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stderr looks okay!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
```
## Redirecting input
First, we redirect the output `CHALLENGE` into the `PWN` file. This file input is then redirected to `/challenge/run` by using `<`
```
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ echo COLLEGE > PWN
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ /challenge/run < PWN
Reading from standard input...
Correct! You have redirected the PWN file into my standard input, and I read
the value 'COLLEGE' out of it!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{gVAgJeIRZonDdYBh4cWK41pHUNg.dBzN1QDL3IDO0czW}
```
## Grepping stored results
Okay so here, we first redirect the output of `/challenge/run` to the file `/tmp/data.txt` and then `grep` that data to get the flag.
```
Connected!
hacker@piping~grepping-stored-results:~$ /challenge/run > /tmp/data.txt
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge will check that output is redirected to a specific file path : /tmp/data.txt
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /challenge/.data.txt

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the /challenge/.data.txt file.

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to a file called /tmp/data.txt. Checking...

[HINT] File descriptors are inherited from the parent, unless the FD_CLOEXEC is set by the parent on the file descriptor.
[HINT] For security reasons, some programs, such as python, do this by default in certain cases. Be careful if you are
[HINT] creating and trying to pass in FDs in python.

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stdout looks okay!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
hacker@piping~grepping-stored-results:~$ grep 'pwn.college*' /tmp/data.txt
pwn.college{k3PzMC0gmInpcmUif0TBjkRIaec.dhTM4QDL5MTM1czW}
```
## Grepping live output
Here we are asked to do the same thing as the last challenge except we read the live output by using the `|` command.

```
hacker@piping~grepping-live-output:~$ /challenge/run | grep pwn.college
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stdout : grep
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /challenge/.data.txt

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the /challenge/.data.txt file.

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to another process. Checking...
[TEST] Performing checks on that process!

[INFO] The process' executable is /nix/store/xpq4yhadyhazkcsggmqd7rsgvxb3kjy4-gnugrep-3.11/bin/grep.
[INFO] This might be different than expected because of symbolic links (for example, from /usr/bin/python to /usr/bin/python3 to /usr/bin/python3.8).
[INFO] To pass the checks, the executable must be grep.

[PASS] You have passed the checks on the process on the other end of my stdout!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
pwn.college{ojFfED92zKqo5TiuNYEbD0LizuY.dhTM4QDL3IDO0czW}
```
## Grepping errors
Now here, we are using `2>&1` to redirect the standard error to standard output and then grepping the combined `stderr` and `stdout` to get the flag.
```
hacker@piping~grepping-errors:~$ /challenge/run 2>&1 | grep pwn.college
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stderr : grep
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /challenge/.data.txt

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the /challenge/.data.txt file.

[TEST] You should have redirected my stderr to another process. Checking...
[TEST] Performing checks on that process!

[INFO] The process' executable is /nix/store/xpq4yhadyhazkcsggmqd7rsgvxb3kjy4-gnugrep-3.11/bin/grep.
[INFO] This might be different than expected because of symbolic links (for example, from /usr/bin/python to /usr/bin/python3 to /usr/bin/python3.8).
[INFO] To pass the checks, the executable must be grep.

[PASS] You have passed the checks on the process on the other end of my stderr!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.

```
## Duplicating piped data with tee
For this challenge, we use `tee` to intercept `pwn` and get its secret code and pipe it into `/challenge/college`.
```
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ /challenge/pwn | tee pwn | /challenge/college
Processing...
The input to 'college' does not contain the correct secret code! This code 
should be provided by the 'pwn' command. HINT: use 'tee' to intercept the 
output of 'pwn' and figure out what the code needs to be.
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ cat pwn
Usage: /challenge/pwn --secret [SECRET_ARG]

SECRET_ARG should be "N9sZHmLe"
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ /challenge/pwn --secret N9sZHmLe | /challenge/college
Processing...
Correct! Passing secret value to /challenge/college...
Great job! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{06YhmwhVs2NK-VVir57P7ydvQ9m.dFjM5QDL3IDO0czW}
```
## Writing to multiple programs
Here, by using `tee >()` we can write the command output as input to the respective programs.
```
hacker@piping~writing-to-multiple-programs:~$ /challenge/hack | tee >(/challenge/the) >(/challenge/planet)
This secret data must directly and simultaneously make it to /challenge/the and
/challenge/planet. Don't try to copy-paste it; it changes too fast.
291661988475722870
Congratulations, you have duplicated data into the input of two programs! Here
is your flag:
pwn.college{scpmU_G2Y3AU0IAMA_kiWxMzsx-.dBDO0UDL5MTM1czW}
```
## Split-piping stderr and stdout
The last challenge is quite a handful. For this challenge, by using `2>` and `>()` together to pipe `stderr` while using `1>` and `>()` to pipe `stdout`, we can get the flag. 
```
hacker@piping~split-piping-stderr-and-stdout:~$ /challenge/hack 2> >(/challenge/the) > >(/challenge/planet)
Congratulations, you have learned a redirection technique that even experts 
struggle with! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{olkXX6en7tSATvDcw7-5sT7JPEs.dFDNwYDL5MTM1czW}
```
