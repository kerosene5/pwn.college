# Module 12: Pondering PATH
This is the 12th and final module of the Linux Luminarium dojo.
# Challenges
## The PATH Variable 
The `PATH` variable stores the directories of all the useful commands we have seen so for like `ls`, `cat` and so on. In this challenge, the `/challenge/run` program would have deleted the flag using the `rm` command so we had to clear the `PATH` variable, in order to get the flag.
```
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ PATH=" "
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ /challenge/run
Trying to remove /flag...
/challenge/run: line 4: rm: command not found
The flag is still there! I might as well give it to you!

```
## Setting PATH
Here, we wanted to add the directory of the `win` command to the `PATH` variable, so that `/challenge/run` could run it and get us the flag.
```
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ PATH=/challenge/more_commands
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ /challenge/run
Invoking 'win'....
Congratulations! You properly set the flag and 'win' has launched!

## Adding Commands
For this challenge, I had to find the directory of the `cat` command since changing the `PATH` variable would have rendered `cat` inaccesible to the shell. The location was known to me as `/run/workspace/bin/cat`, which turned out to be a symbolic link to `run/dojo/bin/cat`. So I used the latter in the challenge. After doing that and adding the directory of the script to the `PATH` variable, I launched the `/challenge/run` program to find the flag.
```
hacker@path~adding-commands:~$ cd solution
hacker@path~adding-commands:~/solution$ echo "/run/dojo/bin/cat /flag" > /home/hacker/solution/win
hacker@path~adding-commands:~/solution$ chmod +x win
hacker@path~adding-commands:~/solution$ PATH=/home/hacker/solution
hacker@path~adding-commands:~/solution$ /challenge/run
Invoking 'win'....

```
## Hijacking Commands
This here is the final challenge of All Time. For this challenge, I had to change the directory of the `rm` command and make that an executable. After that, I just added the directory of that to the `PATH` variable and launched the `/challenge/run` to get the flag. Finally, it has been done.
```
hacker@path~hijacking-commands:~$ echo "/run/dojo/bin/cat /flag" > rm
hacker@path~hijacking-commands:~$ chmod +x rm
hacker@path~hijacking-commands:~$ PATH=/home/hacker
hacker@path~hijacking-commands:~$ /challenge/run
Trying to remove /flag...
