# Module 8: Processes and Jobs
This module dives into Linux processes. Beginning with the initialization process (`init`), which serves as the root of the process hierarchy.
# Challenges
## Listing Processes
In this challenge, we were introduced to two commands which are similar but give slightly different outputs that is, `ps -ef` and `ps aux`. I used `ps -ef` to see the renamed `/challenge/run` command and ran it to get the flag.
```
hacker@processes~listing-processes:~$ ps -ef

Yahaha, you found me! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{YOwxmu1VeIMuqzgzQwCzdCZpx9L.dhzM4QDL0QjN5YzW}
Now I will sleep for a while (so that you could find me with 'ps').
```
## Killing Processes
This challenge taught us how to use the `kill` command to terminate unecessary processes. We need to `kill` the process `/challenge/dont_run` in order to run the `/challenge/run` command.
The syntax for `kill` is `kill [PID]`. PID refers to the process identifier of the program or command that is to be deleted.
Here, the PID was 73.
```

hacker@processes~killing-processes:~$ kill 73
hacker@processes~killing-processes:~$ /challenge/run
Great job! Here is your payment:
pwn.college{cTo1gXT1wIfsWepCkwhvRCJy0IV.dJDN4QDL0QjN5YzW}
```
## Interrupting Processes
This challenge was an easy one. We just needed to interrupt the `/challenge/run` process to get the flag. This was done by the `ctrl+c` command.
```
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember, 
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
Good job! You have used Ctrl-C to interrupt this process! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{IXOHGlXEKF0C8DcSzZNdGo_yrMq.dNDN4QDL0QjN5YzW}
```
## Suspending Processes
Instead of terminating a command, we may want to sometimes suspend it. That is achieved using the `ctrl+z` hotkey. This challenge required me to launch the `/challenge/run` command, suspend it and then run `/challenge/run` again in order to get the flag.
```
hacker@processes~suspending-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running in 
this terminal... Let's check!

UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root         376     316  0 10:38 pts/0    00:00:00 bash /challenge/run
root         378     376  0 10:38 pts/0    00:00:00 ps -f

I don't see a second me!

To pass this level, you need to suspend me and launch me again! You can 
background me with Ctrl-Z or, if you're not ready to do that for whatever 
reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 /challenge/run
hacker@processes~suspending-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running in 
this terminal... Let's check!

UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root         376     316  0 10:38 pts/0    00:00:00 bash /challenge/run
root         431     316  0 10:39 pts/0    00:00:00 bash /challenge/run
root         433     431  0 10:39 pts/0    00:00:00 ps -f

Yay, I found another version of me! Here is the flag:
pwn.college{UbK6hYwOaRFurN6TlcsxoH3rs9y.dVDN4QDL0QjN5YzW}
```
## Resuming Processes
When we suspend a process, we will eventually need to resume it. This is done through the `fg` builtin command that will resume suspended processes in the *foreground*.
To get the flag in this challenge, I had to suspend `/challenge/run` and then resume it using `fg` to get the flag.
```
hacker@processes~resuming-processes:~$ /challenge/run
Let's practice resuming processes! Suspend me with Ctrl-Z, then resume me with 
the 'fg' command! Or just press Enter to quit me!
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 /challenge/run
hacker@processes~resuming-processes:~$ fg
/challenge/run
I'm back! Here's your flag:
pwn.college{QoXLDGi_IlEibOVGGq5te8ZAtvk.dZDN4QDL0QjN5YzW}
Don't forget to press Enter to quit me!

Goodbye!
```
## Backgrounding Processes
To resume processes in the *background* instead of the *foreground* using `fg`, we will use the `bg` command. The challenge is the same as before except this time, I used the `bg` command.
```
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running *and 
not suspended* in this terminal... Let's check!

UID          PID STAT CMD
root         660 S+   bash /challenge/run
root         662 R+   ps -o user=UID,pid,stat,cmd

I don't see a second me!

To pass this level, you need to suspend me, resume the suspended process in the 
background, and then launch a new version of me! You can background me with 
Ctrl-Z (and resume me in the background with 'bg') or, if you're not ready to 
do that for whatever reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 /challenge/run
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$ bg
[1]+ /challenge/run &



Yay, I'm now running the background! Because of that, this text will probably 
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt. Don't panic; just hit Enter a few times 
to scroll this text out.
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running *and 
not suspended* in this terminal... Let's check!

root         696 S    sleep 6h
root         735 S+   bash /challenge/run
root         737 R+   ps -o user=UID,pid,stat,cmd

Yay, I found another version of me running in the background! Here is the flag:
pwn.college{AwLrjP27pFTqwxDUfo5AERQ9FGx.ddDN4QDL0QjN5YzW}
```
## Foregrounding Processes
For this challenge, we had to suspend the `/challenge/run` process, then resume it in the *background* using `bg` and then resume it in the *foreground* using the `fg` command to get the flag.
```
hacker@processes~foregrounding-processes:~$ /challenge/run
To pass this level, you need to suspend me, resume the suspended process in the 
background, and *then* foreground it without re-suspending it! You can 
background me with Ctrl-Z (and resume me in the background with 'bg') or, if 
you're not ready to do that for whatever reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 /challenge/run
hacker@processes~foregrounding-processes:~$ bg
[1]+ /challenge/run &



Yay, I'm now running the background! Because of that, this text will probably 
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt. Don't panic; just hit Enter a few times 
to scroll this text out. After that, resume me into the foreground with 'fg'; 
I'll wait.
hacker@processes~foregrounding-processes:~$ fg
/challenge/run
YES! Great job! I'm now running in the foreground. Hit Enter for your flag!

pwn.college{Ae9YL4_Z2rSuOccS75H92e5fZOG.dhDN4QDL0QjN5YzW}
```
## Starting Backgrounded Processes
In this challenge, we learnt how to start a backgrounded process right off the bat using the `&` appended to the command we want to run in the background.
```
hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$ /challenge/run &
[1] 384



Yay, you started me in the background! Because of that, this text will probably 
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt, but you're used to that by now...

Anyways! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{INmCL1l5JuA_l9om6MMNsUF3VvA.dlDN4QDL0QjN5YzW}
[1]+  Done                    /challenge/run

```
## Process Exit Codes
Here, we had to find the exit code of `/challenge/get-code` using `$?`. Using that code with the command `/challenge/submit-code`, we got the flag.
```
hacker@processes~process-exit-codes:~$ /challenge/get-code $?
Exiting with an error code!
hacker@processes~process-exit-codes:~$ echo $?
245
hacker@processes~process-exit-codes:~$ /challenge/submit-code 245
CORRECT! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{cFEBXYLLZFIwZNaBosmMlu-OHGW.dljN4UDL0QjN5YzW}

```
