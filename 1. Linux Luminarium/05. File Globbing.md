# Module 5:  File Globbing
Before executing commands that we enter, the shell first performs expansions on them, and one of these expansions is globbing. Globbing lets you reference files without typing them all out, or typing out their full paths.

File globbing is a powerful feature that allows matching file paths using wildcard patterns. While convenient, file globbing can introduce subtle issues in build systems that are important to understand.
# Challenges
## Matching with *
The first glob is `*`. When it encounters a `*` character in any argument, the shell will treat it as "wildcard" and try to replace that argument with any files that match the pattern.
* For example:
   ```
   echo Look: file_*
   Look: file_a file_b file_c
   ```
   
The `*` matches any part of the filename except for `/` or
a leading `.` character.

Here we replace `/challenge` with just `/*ge` while changing directories. Once it successfully goes to the right directory, we run the correct command to get the flag.
```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /ch*
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{cJQRLxCDwl5pZXH8E_iUr-3Mh2m.dFjM4QDL5MTM1czW}
```
## Matching with ?
Next is `?`. When it encounters a `?` character in any argument, the shell will treat it as single-character wildcard. This works like `*`, but only matches one character.
* For example:
```
echo Look: file_?
Look: file_a file_b
echo Look: file_??
Look: file_cc
```

The `?` can be used in a similar way as `*` but instead it only matches one character. Hence we have used one `?` for every missing character in `/challenge` to get into the right directory and get the flag.
```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /?ha??enge
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0IovPNlYhcdoWpW8eyJBWejfIay.dJjM4QDL5MTM1czW}
```
## Matching with []
And last is `[]`. The square brackets are, essentially a limited form of `?`, in that instead of matching any character, `[]` is a wildcard for some subset of potential characters, specified within the brackets.

So, using `[]` to glob multiple file names by using it as `file_[absh]`
```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge/files$ ls file_[absh]
file_a  file_b  file_h  file_s
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run file_[absh]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{MdKD5JILsBPEyGYrUPzkDm_1Mky.dNjM4QDL5MTM1czW}
```
## Matching paths with []
Same as before but using absolute paths while globbing with `[]`.
```
hacker@globbing~matching-paths-with-:~$ /challenge/run /challenge/files/file_[absh]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{w_WAYF7Rg57sX8wFM6X8I5lrZMk.dRjM4QDL5MTM1czW}
```
## Mixing globs
Okay, so here we used `[]` and `*` glob to get the file names.
```
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [cep]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{8iqMkBoukdhN33XEfYYSw_pnhlo.dVjM4QDLxITN0czW}
```
## Exclusionary globbing
Aand here, we used `^` in the front of the characters in the `[]` glob to exclude those characters while looking in the file names.

```
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [^pwn]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{Q0XYsLBFDWsyLlRejkoFipNQ0K-.dZjM4QDL5MTM1czW}
```
