# Module 1: Hello Hackers
This module is meant to make us familiar with the basics of the command line interface (CLI), such as the command prompt and how to enter commands.

First, we got an overview of the command prompt, breaking down its components: username, hostname, and user privilege indicator `$` or `#`(admin).

Then it showed us some simple commands like `echo`. Using `echo`, we explored how to pass additional information to commands like “Hello” to print and output

All of this culminated in challenges that gave us ‘flags’ that are required to complete that challenge. This set the format for future modules with the goal of finding flags using the new commands and concepts.
