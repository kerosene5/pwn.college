# Module 9: Perceiving Permissions
# Challenges
## Changing File Ownership
In this challenge, we had to change the owner of the file from `root` to `hacker` using the `chown` command in order to get the flag.
```
hacker@permissions~changing-file-ownership:~$ chown hacker /flag
hacker@permissions~changing-file-ownership:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{YZrCQNXEvphUThkd5EjZCyKDmCB.dFTM2QDL0QjN5YzW}
```
## Groups and Files
This challenge was the same as the previous one, except instead of changing ownership of the file through `chown` we used `chgrp` to gain access to the group ownership of the `/flag` file. Then all we had to do was `cat /flag` in order to get the flag.
```
hacker@permissions~groups-and-files:~$ chgrp hacker /flag
hacker@permissions~groups-and-files:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{828i-GNL4tbf8peJjgzWTcm7iWX.dFzNyUDL0QjN5YzW}
```
## Fun with Groups Names 
This challenge was again, the same as the previous one, except that the group we belong to was randomized, so we had to use the `id` command to view the group we were in, and then `chgrp` to obtain the flag.
```
hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ id
uid=1000(hacker) gid=1000(grp28141) groups=1000(grp28141)
hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ chgrp grp28141 /flag
hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{YeHeGzWrf4mT4SZZUMN0-HkaLTn.dJzNyUDL0QjN5YzW}
```
## Changing Permissions
Here, we had to change the permissions of the `/flag` file in order to be able to read it. That was done by using the `chmod` command along with an argument of `a+rw` which denoted that all other users could read/write to it.
```
hacker@permissions~changing-permissions:~$ chmod a+rw /flag
hacker@permissions~changing-permissions:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{Qn5PE6DLYxO8baASs_VCoIvpLpm.dNzNyUDL0QjN5YzW}
```
## Executable Files
Here, we had to make the `/challenge/run` program executable to the `hacker` user by using `chmod a+x` which allowed all users to execute the program, in order to get the flag.
```
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ chmod o+x /challenge/run
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ /challenge/run
bash: /challenge/run: Permission denied
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ chmod a+x /challenge/run
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ /challenge/run
Successful execution! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{MNYEvYWYVTjTe6V8QocwhWg0pZa.dJTM2QDL0QjN5YzW}
```
## Permissions Tweaking Practice
Practice using the `chmod` command. Had 8 Rounds of `chmod`.

## Permissions Setting Practice
Same lengthy challenge as before but here we used `=` instead of `+/-` with `chmod` which means that the command will overwrite the original permissions instead of modifying them.

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod a+rw /flag
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{8_LNCUUcHz3sZBuH85GU418yh0X.dNTM5QDL0QjN5YzW}
```
## The SUID Bit
Here we used the `chmod` command with `+s` to add a SUID Bit which will allow users which aren't owners of that file (in this case, `/flag`) to able to get ownership of that file.
```
hacker@permissions~the-suid-bit:~$ chmod u+s /challenge/getroot
hacker@permissions~the-suid-bit:~$ /challenge/getroot
SUCCESS! You have set the suid bit on this program, and it is running as root! 
Here is your shell...
root@permissions~the-suid-bit:~# cat /flag
pwn.college{spv1oS4UMGnbzk-dOtega0SY9bN.dNTM2QDL0QjN5YzW}
```
