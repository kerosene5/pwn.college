# Module 10: Untangling Users
# Challenges
## Becoming root with su
We used the `su` command (superuser) along with the password `hack-the-planet` to enter a `root` shell and used `cat /flag` there to get the flag.
```
hacker@users~becoming-root-with-su:~$ su
Password: 
root@users~becoming-root-with-su:/home/hacker# cat /flag
pwn.college{gCU5F3Mbdfn4T8MRWytMhuEIziH.dVTN0UDL0QjN5YzW}
```
## Other users with su
Here, we used `su` along with the user we want to change to as an argument (in this case, `Zardus`). After creating the shell as user `Zardus` using the passwword `dont-hack-me` along with `su`, I ran the `/challenge/run` program to get the flag.
```
Password: 
zardus@users~other-users-with-su:/home/hacker$ /challenge/run
Congratulations, you have become Zardus! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0AO5SrOyGL-cVQ0kNRVXdv0bCyz.dZTN0UDL0QjN5YzW}
```
## Cracking passwords
This was quite a fun challenge. In order to get the password for the `zardus` user, we used a leaked `/etc/shadow` file to decrypt the password hashes using the `john` (John the Ripper) program, giving us the password `aardvark`. After this, I followed the same steps as the previous challenge to get the flag.
```
hacker@users~cracking-passwords:~$ john /challenge/shadow-leak
Created directory: /home/hacker/.john

WARNING: you are invoking 'su' without specifying the 'zardus' user.
su: user Zardus does not exist
hacker@users~cracking-passwords:~$ su zardus

Congratulations, you have become Zardus! Here is your flag:

```
## Using sudo
Okay, so this command `sudo` (superuser do) is now used to run root-access programs instead of `su`. `sudo` only run a command as a root user and does not create a root shell. In this challenge, we had to use `sudo` along with `cat /flag` to read the flag. 
```
hacker@users~using-sudo:~$ sudo cat /flag
pwn.college{YD2-5UM2NPBTdNiDd2lBg1VvqWo.dhTN0UDL0QjN5YzW}
```
